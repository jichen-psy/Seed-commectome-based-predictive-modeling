# Seed-commectome-based-predictive-modeling




Our predictive modelingnode is based on a relevance vector machine (RVM) (Tipping, 2001) as implemented in the SparseBayes package (http://www.miketipping.com/index.htm). The RVM refers to a specialization of the general Bayesian framework which has an identical functional form to the support vector machine. To implement our predictive modeling with different validation schemes (i.e., 10-fold cross-validation, leave-one-site-out cross-validation, as well as training models within-sample and then validate in independent samples), please add the downloaded SparseBayes package to your Matlab working directory.
