function [var, reg] = regress_confounds(var, DesignMatrix, existing_reg)
% 

% This function regresses out confounds from prediction targets y and features X. 
% For training data, pass in y or X and the DesignMatrix for the confounds (generated from 
% the Matlab x2fx function) to perform regression, obtaining the new y or X and the 
% regression coefficients reg. For validation data, also pass in the regression coefficients 
% obtained from the training data. Basically, regression coefficients should be estimated 
% using only training data, and applied to both training and validation data.
%
% Inputs:
%       - var           :
%                      A Nx1 matrix containing the target values from N
%                      subjects or a NxF matrix containing F features from N    
%
%       - DesignMatrix   :
%                      The design matix of the matrix of confounds generated from the x2fx 
%                      function for regression
%
%       - existing_reg:
%                      (Optional) Existing regression coefficients to use
%                      for regressing out confounds in validation set.
%
% Output:
%        - var    :
%                A vector containing the target values or a matrix containing the features with
%                confounds removed
%        - reg:
%                A cell containing the regression coefficient for
%                each confound and for each target variable y or feature X. The first row of the 
%                column array within a cell correspond to the offset, i.e. a confound of constant 1.
%
% Example:
% 1) [y_train, reg_y] = regress_confounds(y_train, confounds)
%    This command regresses out confounds from the training targets (y), also
%    returning the regression coefficients
% 2) y_val = regress_confounds_y (y_val, confounds, reg_y)
%    This command regresses out confounds from the validation targets,
%    using the regression coefficients previously determined based on
%    training data
